This is an Alexa skill that makes Quizlet a whole new refreshing experience, especially for those who are verbal-lingual learners rather than visual learners. 

## How Could It Be Used?

Well, as a college student, I read a lot. It'd be nice to be able to have a quick review of whatever it is I read the night before. 

So I wake up:

* "Alexa, ask Quizza to review Pramoedya's This Earth of Mankind chapters 1-5."

* "Okay, here we go. Who is Pramoedya?"

* "He is an Indonesian novelist who lived through the Indonesian Communist struggle."

* "Good. He was ... "  <-- Quizlet definition goes here. 

* "Bad. He was actually ..." <-- Listens for keywords to be mentioned before determining response good or bad.
